# Spring Boot JWT Authentication example with Spring Security & Spring Data JPA

## Run Spring Boot application
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Note
The database must contain the necessary roles. These roles are inserted automatically by the `data.sql` file. So, if you wanted to add other roles, you need to include them in the `data.sql` file.
